# MoodPost App - With React JS & Redux 

A modern React app with Redux for state management, functioning as a moodboard-style blogging platform. Users can share posts, react with moods, archive posts, and delete them. The app is built with functional components, hooks, and Redux Toolkit.

## Features

- Create Posts: Users can write posts (up to 280 characters) with an optional author name. Posts can include hashtags (e.g., #express).
- Mood Reactions: Users can react to posts with three moods: Happy (😊), Sad (😢), and Fire (🔥). Reactions include a floating animation.
- Archive Posts: Posts can be archived and viewed in a separate "Archive" tab.
- Delete Posts: Users can delete posts with a confirmation prompt.
- Tabs: Switch between "Feed" (active posts) and "Archive" (archived posts) views.
- Persistent Storage: Posts are saved to localStorage and persist across page reloads.
- Responsive Design: The app is styled for both desktop and mobile devices (responsive at 480px and below).
- Animations: Includes subtle animations for rendering posts (slideUp, fadeIn) and mood reactions (floatUp).

## Tech Stack

- React: Built with modern React (functional components, hooks like useState for local component state).
- Redux: Uses @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux for centralized state management.
- CSS: Custom styles with CSS variables, animations, and responsive design.
- Font Awesome: For icons (e.g., user, archive, trash).
- Google Fonts: Uses the Poppins font for a clean, modern look.
- localStorage: For persisting posts across sessions.

## Test the App:

   - Create a post by entering some text (e.g., "Hello #test") and an optional author name, then click "Post".
   - React to posts with mood buttons (😊, 😢, 🔥).
   - Archive or delete posts using the respective buttons.
   - Switch between "Feed" and "Archive" tabs to view active or archived posts.

## Usage

- **Creating a Post**:
  - Enter your name (optional) in the "Your name" field.
  - Write your post in the textarea (max 280 characters).
  - Click the "Post" button to share your post.
  - The post will appear in the "Feed" tab.

- **Reacting to Posts**:
  - Click the mood buttons (😊, 😢, 🔥) to add a reaction. The reaction count will increment, and a floating animation will play.

- **Archiving Posts**:
  - Click the archive icon to move a post to the "Archive" tab.
  - In the "Archive" tab, click the unarchive icon to move it back to "Feed".

- **Deleting Posts**:
  - Click the trash icon to delete a post. A confirmation prompt will appear.

- **Switching Tabs**:
  - Use the "Feed" and "Archive" tabs to switch between active and archived posts.

## Styling

The app uses a custom `style.css` file with the following features:
- **CSS Variables**: Colors and shadows are defined using CSS custom properties (e.g., `--primary: #31473A`).
- **Animations**: Includes `fadeIn`, `slideUp`, and `floatUp` animations for smooth transitions.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout and font sizes for screens smaller than 480px.
- **Font Awesome Icons**: Used for user, archive, trash, and other icons.
- **Google Fonts**: Uses the Poppins font for a clean, modern look.

## Known Issues

**Mood Animation**: The mood reaction animation uses React state to manage floating emojis. For more complex animations, consider using a library like `framer-motion`.
